Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-04-22
Status: Draft
Author: Gemini AI (Based on user concept)
Stakeholders: Product Management, Engineering, UX/UI Design, QA, Marketing, Sales

1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the AI-Assisted Manual Logging Tool (placeholder name: "LogEasy" / "TimeSuggest" - TBD). The primary goal of this tool is to alleviate the common pain points associated with manual time tracking â€“ namely, the time-consuming, cumbersome, and often inaccurate nature of the process. LogEasy integrates with existing Project Management (PM) tools and uses AI-driven suggestions based on contextual user activity to make logging time significantly faster and easier, without resorting to privacy-invasive background monitoring. It enhances the existing manual workflow rather than replacing it entirely.

2. Goals & Objectives

Reduce Time Logging Friction: Significantly decrease the time and effort users spend manually logging their work hours.
Improve Logging Accuracy & Consistency: Help users recall activities and log time more accurately and regularly by providing relevant suggestions.
Enhance User Satisfaction: Provide a more pleasant and efficient user experience compared to logging directly within complex PM tools.
Maintain User Privacy & Control: Ensure users have explicit control over data access and avoid passive background monitoring techniques.
Seamless Integration: Provide reliable and secure integration with popular PM tools.
3. Target Audience

Professionals (e.g., consultants, developers, designers, marketers, agency staff) who are required to log time against specific projects or tasks within project management systems like Zoho Projects, Jira, Asana, etc., and find the current process tedious.

4. User Stories

As a Consultant, I want to connect LogEasy securely to my company's Jira instance, so that I can see my assigned tasks without needing to open Jira separately for logging.
As a Developer, I want LogEasy to suggest tasks I might have worked on based on my recent calendar meetings and the files I've modified, so that I don't forget to log time for short or intermittent activities.
As a Designer, I want to see a clear list of my tasks for the day/week pulled from Asana, with AI suggestions highlighted, so that I can quickly identify what needs logging.
As a Project Manager, I want my team members to use a tool that makes logging time easier and more accurate, so that project reporting and billing are more reliable.
As any User, I want a simple interface to click a button next to a suggested (or manually selected) task and quickly enter the duration (e.g., "1.5h" or select from presets), so that logging takes seconds, not minutes.
As any User, I want the option to use a simple start/stop timer associated directly with my tasks in the LogEasy interface, so that I can track time precisely for focused work blocks.
As any User, I want a transparent and easy-to-use settings panel where I can grant or revoke access to my calendar, file activity, or communication metadata, so that I feel in control of my privacy.
5. Functional Requirements

5.1. Core Functionality
* FR-001: PM Tool Integration:
* Securely authenticate and connect to specified PM tools using OAuth 2.0 where possible.
* Initial supported tools: [Specify 1-3 target PM tools, e.g., Jira, Asana, Zoho Projects].
* Fetch assigned tasks, project names/IDs, and potentially task statuses relevant to the authenticated user.
* Regular synchronization (configurable, e.g., every 15-30 minutes, or on-demand) to reflect task updates.
* FR-002: Simplified Task Dashboard:
* Display a clean list of the user's assigned tasks fetched from the integrated PM tool(s).
* Allow filtering/viewing tasks by "Today" or "This Week" (based on due dates or custom logic TBD).
* Clearly indicate the source project for each task.
* FR-003: AI-Powered Task Suggestions:
* Analyze permitted contextual data sources to generate suggestions for tasks the user likely worked on.
* Present suggestions prominently within the UI, distinct from the main task list.
* Suggestions should link directly to tasks from the PM tool.
* Provide a reason for the suggestion (e.g., "Based on Calendar event: Project X Sync", "Based on recent file: proposal_v3.docx").
* FR-004: Quick Logging Interface:
* Allow users to initiate logging from either a suggested task or a task in the main list.
* Present a minimal form/modal for time entry.
* Pre-fill the Task/Project based on selection.
* Allow quick duration entry (e.g., direct input "1h 15m", "+1h" button, potentially suggested duration based on context like calendar event length).
* Include optional fields (configurable based on PM tool needs): Notes/Description, Billable toggle.
* Submit logged time back to the integrated PM tool via its API.
* FR-005: Optional Integrated Timer:
* Provide Start/Stop timer buttons directly associated with each task in the dashboard list.
* Running a timer updates its duration in real-time within the UI.
* Stopping a timer pre-fills the Quick Logging form with the elapsed duration.
* Only one timer can be active at a time.

5.2. Data Sources & AI
* FR-006: Calendar Integration (Optional, Permission-Based):
* Securely connect to user's calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar) via OAuth 2.0.
* Read event titles, attendees, and start/end times for recent/current events.
* Use NLP to extract keywords/project names from event titles to correlate with PM tasks.
* Data Handling: Do not store full event descriptions or sensitive details. Focus on metadata relevant for suggestions.
* FR-007: File Activity Monitoring (Optional, Permission-Based):
* Requires explicit user permission and potentially a lightweight local agent/browser extension.
* Monitor metadata of recently accessed/modified file names and paths.
* Use NLP/rules to extract keywords/project identifiers from filenames/paths.
* Data Handling: Do not read file contents. Only process metadata locally or transmit securely if absolutely necessary for cloud-based suggestion engine. Prioritize local processing.
* FR-008: Communication Metadata (Optional, Permission-Based):
* Integrate with communication tools (e.g., Email subject lines via Gmail/Outlook API, Slack channel names/message subjects via API) with explicit permission.
* Extract keywords/project identifiers from subject lines or channel names.
* Data Handling: Do not read email/message bodies. Focus solely on relevant metadata for suggestions.
* FR-009: PM Tool Task Analysis:
* Analyze keywords within the user's assigned task titles and descriptions in the PM tool itself to improve suggestion relevance.

5.3. User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)
* FR-010: Dashboard Layout: Web-based dashboard and/or optional lightweight desktop widget. Clean, uncluttered design.
* FR-011: Suggestions Panel: Clearly delineated section for AI suggestions with quick-log actions.
* FR-012: Minimal Log Form: Inline or pop-up form designed for speed and minimal interaction.
* FR-013: Permissions Center: Clear, granular interface for users to view, grant, and revoke access permissions for each data source (PM tool, Calendar, Files, Comms). Explain why each permission is needed.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-001: Performance: Dashboard load time < 3 seconds. Suggestion generation time < 5 seconds (after initial data sync). API calls to PM tools should be efficient.
NFR-002: Security:
Use OAuth 2.0 for all external service integrations. Securely store tokens.
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
Implement standard web security practices (Input validation, protection against XSS, CSRF, etc.).
Regular security audits.
NFR-003: Privacy:
Adhere strictly to user permissions. No data accessed without explicit consent.
Anonymize or aggregate data where possible if used for improving the suggestion engine globally.
Compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Provide clear Privacy Policy detailing data usage.
NFR-004: Reliability: High availability for the service. Robust error handling for API integrations (e.g., retry mechanisms, clear error messages to user).
NFR-005: Usability: The interface must be significantly more intuitive and faster for the core logging task than using the native PM tool interface. Minimal learning curve.
NFR-006: Scalability: Architecture should support adding new PM tool integrations and a growing user base.
7. Design & UX Considerations

Focus on a "glanceable" dashboard.
Prioritize speed and reduction of clicks for the core logging flow.
Make AI suggestions helpful but unobtrusive; allow easy dismissal or ignoring of suggestions.
Ensure the value proposition (time saving, ease of use) is immediately apparent.
Provide clear feedback to the user (e.g., "Time logged successfully to Jira").
8. Data & AI Model Details

The initial AI suggestion model may rely heavily on keyword matching, NLP (Named Entity Recognition for projects/tasks), and rule-based logic correlating data sources (e.g., calendar event title keywords + recent file name keywords -> Suggest Task X).
Future iterations could explore more sophisticated ML models, but V1 should focus on delivering core value reliably.
Emphasis on processing data minimally and locally where feasible (especially file activity).
9. Permissions & Security (Reinforced)

User consent is paramount before accessing any data source (PM Tool, Calendar, Files, Comms).
Permissions must be granular (user can enable calendar but disable file access).
Easy revocation of permissions must be available at all times.
Authentication with PM tools and other services must use secure, standard methods (OAuth 2.0 preferred).
10. Future Considerations / Out of Scope for V1

Out of Scope: Fully automated time tracking based on background monitoring.
Out of Scope: Mobile application (consider for V2).
Out of Scope: Advanced reporting and analytics within LogEasy (users rely on PM tool reporting).
Out of Scope: Integration with all possible PM/Calendar/Comm tools (start focused).
Out of Scope: Automatically submitting timesheets (requires user review and confirmation).
Future: Browser extension for richer context gathering (with permission).
Future: Deeper AI learning based on user acceptance/rejection of suggestions.
Future: Team views or manager approvals (focus on individual productivity first).
11. Success Metrics

Adoption Rate: % of target users actively using the tool weekly.
Task Logging Frequency: Increase in the number of days/times users log time compared to baseline.
Time Spent Logging: Reduction in average time taken per logging session (measured via analytics or surveys).
User Satisfaction: Net Promoter Score (NPS) or specific satisfaction survey results (e.g., "How much easier is logging time with this tool?").
Suggestion Utility: % of logs initiated from an AI suggestion; user feedback on suggestion quality.
PM Tool Sync Reliability: Low error rate for API interactions.
